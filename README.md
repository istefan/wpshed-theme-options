# WordPress Theme Options Framework

**Please note:** Theme options pages are not standard in WordPress anymore. It is highly recommended that you move all your theme settings in the Customizer.

We do have a Theme Customizer Framework as well to make your workflow easier. Check it out here: [https://github.com/istefan/wpshed-theme-customizer](https://github.com/istefan/wpshed-theme-customizer)

Details and instructions here: [https://wpshed.com/wordpress/wordpress-theme-customizer-framework/](https://wpshed.com/wordpress/wordpress-theme-customizer-framework/)

However, if you'd like to include a Theme Options page, there's more information about how to implement it here: [WPshed Theme Options](http://wpshed.com/wordpress-theme-options-framework/).
